I"–<p>Iâ€™m taking electric bass lessons from the Fender website. 
I started a 14-day free trial for lessons at the Fender Play website: <a href="https://www.fender.com/play/pages/bass-lessons">Fender Play Bass Lessons</a>. </p>
<p>
I practiced for about 20-40 minutes yesterday with their online videos.</p>
<p>It looks like I can work with their videos, so I subscribed for a year ($122 CDN).</p>

<p>Yesterday, I did the first 3 lessons in the Fender series.</p>
<p>It surprised me I have to cut my right hand nails for it; something I reluctantly did, coz I need them for classical guitar.</p>
<p>I guess I'll have to concentrate on bass, violin and piano for awhile with these short nails.</p>
