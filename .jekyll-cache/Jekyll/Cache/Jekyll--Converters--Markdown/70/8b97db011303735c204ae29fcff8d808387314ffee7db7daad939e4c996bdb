I"„<p>I was watching YouTube last week, and noticed this guy, Derek Banas, put out a video on every computer language thatâ€™s popular.  Then I read some comments which asked how he did it?  Then I began to wonder myself.  You canâ€™t become an expert on that much stuff, normally.  So I watched one of his videos on how he learns stuff, and also read some of his responses to comments.</p>
