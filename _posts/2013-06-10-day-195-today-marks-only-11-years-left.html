<p>Today June 10th, 2013 marks the date where I finally have only 11 years of practice left to get my 10,000 hours.</p>
<p>I've averaged my times since November 28, 2012, and calculated at the going rate, how long it will take me to reach 10,000 hours.Â  By the way, today I practiced 225 minutes, making it 463.28 hours of practice so far.</p>
