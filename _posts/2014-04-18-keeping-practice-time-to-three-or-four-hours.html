<p>I’ve been reading that practising for longer than 3 or 4 hours taxes your muscles too much.  I’ve been experiencing a fair amount of back trouble last week when I was on a binge of treating my piano practice like a full time job.  And I did three days of over four hours, and strangely the other days were a LOT less than three hours.  In this past seven days, there were no days with over four hours practice time, and all of them were at least three hours (or close enough). </p>
<p>My pain has lessened, and I like the more consistent numbers each day.</p>
<p>I started a new YouTube channel yesterday, here’s last night’s video:<br />
