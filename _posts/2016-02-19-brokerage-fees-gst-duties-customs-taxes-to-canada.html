<h1>Shipping Raspberry PI from Hong Kong to Canada with no Brokerage Fees</h1>
<p>NONE!  None whatsoever.  No hidden charges, no brokerage fees, no charges asked by the post office, no GST, nothing.</p>
<p>I bought my PI 2 from <a href="http://stores.ebay.ca/hundredpluscom">http://stores.ebay.ca/hundredpluscom</a> and paid $57.43CDN, exactly as it says in ebay.ca (well it's probably cheaper by now).  When I went to check out, there were no hidden charges, and my paypal amount was $57.43.</p>
<p>I ordered on February 1st and it arrived February 18th.  (17 days later).  It came to my front door from the Canada Post guy who asked for a signature, then handed over the parcel.  No brokerage fees, no GST, no duties, no nothing.</p>
<p>The envelope it came in was postmarked Germany (I don't know why.   The store is in Hong Kong).  The Customs Declaration affixed to the back of the envelope read:</p>
<ul>
<li>Merchandise</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi 2 - Model B. 1GB RAM.  Qty: 1   Value: 25</li>
<li>Total: .198lbs USD 25</li>
</ul>
<p>I am not affiliated with this seller.  They don't know I'm posting this.  I just wanted to share.</p>
<p>If you find this useful, share the luv, and give me a comment of thanks. :)</p>
