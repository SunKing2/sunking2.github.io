<ul>
<li>The Soviet Union: Now there are a ton of countries such as <a title="Russia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia">Russia,</a> <a title="Kazakhstan" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>, <a title="Turkmenistan" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan<br />
</a> and a few other -istan</li>
<li>Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia: Now we have Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia and others</li>
<li>The solar system had 9 planets.  Pluto is no longer a planet</li>
<li>Persons in the United States whose ancestry traces to Africa were called Negros and later Black for a few years</li>
<li>Electrical outlets: never had polarity.  Two pin plugs could be plugged in any way you like.  And I think 2 pin outlets were common (without the ground wire).</li>
</ul>
