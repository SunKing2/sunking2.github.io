<p>We consume a lot.  At least I do.  Way too much for my liking.  Last night I was watching YouTube videos.  Even though it was not television, it was just a replacement for it, and I found myself consuming.  The weeks that I was learning the Japanese writing system, I was telling myself, that I was doing well, and not spending my time watching television.  But I fall back to it so easily.</p>
<p>I heard once that productive people produce more than they consume.  Makes sense.  But I really have to watch myself to see exactly how much I'm consuming, and when I'm doing it.  Today, for instance, I decided that my computer time was better spent creating a set of beginning music lessons for guitar; possibly for the daughter of a friend of mine, who just got a guitar.  I decided that I could spend my time consuming, i.e. surfing the net, reading garbage on the net, filling my mind with garbage from YouTube and such, but instead I decided to produce and not consume.  It was a conscious decision.</p>
<p>I'm trying to get a little more fit too.  And stop poisoning my body with chips, cookies and coffee.  I've been doing quite well for over three weeks, but even last night I was eating quite a lot; definately more than my body needed; and I was telling myself it was not junk food.  However that's not good enough.  I need to stop overconsuming.</p>
<p>As I said in my last post, we need very little.  I think I read that Buddhists try to eat in the morning and later, but nothing at night, and to keep their meals very modest.</p>
<p>Consumption is not a good thing.  While consuming (watching TV), our advertisements and news programs will tell you it is good; it increases the GNP, and apparently that's supposed to be a good thing.  Well I have my doubts.  We don't need more GNP or even personal income.  The more we have, the worse the problem seems to get.  Consumption begets more consumption.</p>
<p>Hmm, how to live modestly.  I don't know.  I'll have to turn that one over to my higher power.</p>
