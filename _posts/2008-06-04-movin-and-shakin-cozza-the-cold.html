<p>Well, if this don't beat all. I just got an email from my new roomie stating</p>
<div align="right"><span style="font-family:times new roman;"><em>Hey Louie,</p>
<p>I am about ready to storm my lawyer's office and demand some better service.</p>
<p>Called today and was told the 'papers had been [...]</em></span></div>
<div align="right"><span style="font-family:times new roman;"><em>As I write this it is 3:30pm on Wed. Means that I will be at [...not home] for another night. Also means that you will be on the back deck for another night. [...]</em></span></div>
<div align="right"><span style="font-family:times new roman;"><em><br />Hang in there, I will be home fast<br /></em></span></div>
<div align="left"><span style="font-family:times new roman;">Man, just when I thought that it's a sure thing, it's not. I better find someone to stay with soon, or I'm gonna plots. What am I gunna do now? I <strong>could </strong>go back to the river and stay there, but I don't really feel up to it, after the shock of that letter.</span></div>
<div align="left"> </div>
<div align="left"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span></div>
<div align="left"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">I met this nice girl named Dawn at the office I'm at today, and we were kinda exchanging some funny stuff. I saw her at the dance on Saturday, and really at the time, I was thinking that if there were any reason to stay it'd be her. But I was feeling a bit shy; things are easier once you've met someone, sometimes. </span></div>
