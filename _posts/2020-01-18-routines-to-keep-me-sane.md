title: Routines to Keep Me Sane 
---
I've been getting up 15 minutes earlier daily until I get nearer to 10am.  I had to do this when I got up at 1:30 twice.

I've been slowly getting rid of some of the loose papers all over the place by doing daily the folling: Pic up one piece of paper at a time, placing it in a better location (such as a file folder, recycle, or garbage, or box of common stuff).  Keep doing it until you throw 6 items away.  It takes me about 15 or 20 minutes to do daily.  I've been doing it almost two weeks.

I started the week in quite a low mood, and hit a low point when I realized that I couldn't attend the Noon time AA meeting even if I wanted to, and I had cause to; because someone was getting a chip.  So these routines and a very routine day have helped me stay sane.

I do my morning meditation after a shower (as I've always done), making tea during the shower.  Then I read two of the AA pages, writing out gratitudes and things I like about myself.  I then sit quietly for 5 to 10 minutes.

I then do piano until 5pm.  Since I've been getting up after 12pm, this is not so long.  Oh, at 3 I play 5 minutes of violin.  At 3:15, I study words for the Scrabble Club, which I may resume one day.

At 5, I have a bath (to warm up), usually, while making supper.  Then, I read the things on my mirror, read two spiritual pages, listen to Hay for 3 minutes a day, then meditate for 7 minutes.

After that I read 2 pages from about 4 books that I'm reading.  Then I do computer geekery for a few hours, working a little bit on a few programming languages a day.  I'll have a late meal around 930pm.  Then I either do some fun computer stuff, or mess around with my YouTube site, or see developments from Elon Musk's companies, via YouTube.

Here is a work in progress of "The Rose" on piano, with 71% speed (I overestimated how fast I'd been playing), and a few jarring errors, including the last note!  However it's still played in time, so it can be sung over.:[The Rose (Piano Solo), Jan 17, 2020]("https://ia800200.us.archive.org/3/items/GeorgeOrwellsanimalFarmRadioAudio/AnimalFarm02.mp3")
