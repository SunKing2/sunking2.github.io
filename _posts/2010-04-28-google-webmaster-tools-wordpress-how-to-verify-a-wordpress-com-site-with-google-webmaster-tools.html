<p><strong>Google webmaster tools</strong> and <strong>Wordpress</strong>: How To Verify A Wordpress.com site with Google Webmaster Tools</p>
<p>Here's How:</p>
<p>You are probably staring in Google Webmaster Tools Home, and see your wordpress.com site sitting there waiting to be verified.  You probably already did <strong>Add a site...</strong> and you see <strong>Verify this site</strong>.</p>
<p>When you click on <strong>Verify this site</strong>, Google is telling you that you can insert a <strong>meta tag</strong> into your head section of the HTML but you don't think so.  Think again!</p>
<p>The other option it is suggesting is<strong>Upload an HTML</strong> file but you really doubt this, because you have some sense that the .html file name will not be preserved in Wordpress.  You are probably right... read on...</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the Google Webmaster tools page.  If you are not already there, it is here: <a title="Google Webmaster Tools" href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en">https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en</a></li>
<li>This brings you to Google Webmaster Tools Home.  In the <strong>sites</strong> section, Click on <strong>Verify this site</strong>.</li>
<li>This brings you to Google's <strong>Webmaster Central - Verify Ownership</strong> page.    There is a drop-down list box that says <strong>Verification method</strong>.   The options are:
<ul>
<li><strong>Meta tag</strong></li>
<li><strong>Upload an HTML file</strong></li>
<li>something about <strong>DNS</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Select <strong>Meta tag</strong></li>
<li>It then says <strong>Copy the meta tag below, and paste it into your site's home page. It  should go in the &lt;head&gt; section, before the first &lt;body&gt;  section</strong>.  Copy it by selecting it and right clicking on the selected area.</li>
<li>(In a new tab) go to <strong>wordpress.com</strong>, sign in and click on <strong>My Dashboard</strong>.  On the left-hand menu click on <strong>Tools</strong>.</li>
<li>On the Wordpress Tools page for your site, under the item that says <strong>Webmaster Tools Verification</strong> enter the entire meta tag into the textbox that's labelled <strong>Google Webmaster Tools</strong></li>
<li>Hop back to the Google Webmaster Tools page for your wordpress.com site (which if you are any kind of webmaster, you have open in a separate tab), and click <strong>verify</strong>.   Done!</li>
<li><strong>Leave me a comment of thanks :-)</strong></li>
</ol>
