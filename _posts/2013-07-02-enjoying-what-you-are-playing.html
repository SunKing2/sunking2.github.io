<p>I'm reading <a title="The Art of Practicing: Amazon.com" href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Practicing-Guide-Making/dp/0609801775/ref=pd_sim_b_3">The Art of Practicing</a> and one thing that struck me was that practicing should be enjoyable!  I thought it was work!  I've been practicing certain phrases with a very specific number of repeats hoping that it will sink in eventually.  I allocate my piano time and plan out each session with so many minutes.  But Bruser says that we rob ourselves of the beauty of the sound itself.  Get this:</p>
<blockquote><p>The less pleasure we receive, the more we try to force the instrument; gripping it tightly instead of moving simply and comfortably.  This tension impedes the flow of musical vibration through the body.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is so true.  So what I've done today and yesterday was concentrate less on the technical and more on just listening to the music.</p>
<p>Listen up:</p>
<blockquote><p>Practicing is artful, creating something fresh and genuine.  We can practice being spontaneous rather than mechanical.  The spontaneity that marks a strong, communicative performance is actually cultivated during practice sessions.  The qualities of openness, uncertainty, freedom, and aliveness that characterize performing permeate practicing.</p></blockquote>
<p>So I chose to hear the music.  To actually listen.  After all, I have to remember why I chose that piece in the first place.</p>
