<p>Oh, yipes.  I've been <span class="blsp-spelling-error">outa</span> blog-land for a few days it seems.  Lemme see.    On Wednesday night, I went to the <span class="blsp-spelling-error">Intergroup</span> meeting... boring, but our chairperson made sure it ended within an hour.  I saw Kay and Ruth there, sat with Ruth. </p>
<p>Kay: Friend of 7 years who I met in my first several AA meetings.  We both have Dutch roots, and I still like her hair.<br />Ruth: Friend of 5 years who used to go to my home group with Donna.  She was my best friend for the first 4 years, then we kinda drifted into our lives, jobs, families, friends etc.<br />Rick: A guy with about 4 months of sobriety who seems like he's on still on drugs -- High energy level.  Wonder what drug did that to him?   Maybe a future band member?</p>
<p>Thursday and Friday are a blur.  I have no clue.  On Saturday, I went to the Alano dance and its <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected">attendance</span> was terrible.  This chick who seemed to know me (apparently who mentioned my friend Sally's name), asked me to her table to hang, but I'm deaf at dances, and I was saying what a lot.  In retrospect, I probably should just pawed her.  LOL.</p>
<p>But I asked her during 2 separate songs if she wanted to dance, and she didn't like the song, so I pretty much said to myself, screw this noise; I'm gonna go make my own fun, and all women suck anyway.  So I stayed and closed up the place... no almost literally...  I think I left even after the DJ and after the Alano lady.</p>
<p>I went home feeling like I kinda screwed up that one... again.  And I was resolved to not care about my appearance or breath ever again; I'm destined to a life without a woman.  Maybe I'll join a monestary or cult; might as well.</p>
<p>On Sunday, it was band practice at 11:00 a.m. and it went really well.  Our Bass player was really doing well, and I'd asked Rick to join us and sing "Mustang Sally" coz I can't sing it.  Glad I did.  He's our man!  We really freakin' rocked!!!!</p>
<p>I was told on Saturday that Donna's back in the Hospital.  Apparently she'd been there over a week, and left straight from the Roundup a week ago due to cancer-related problems.  I spose I should go see her again.  Hell I'm not doing nothing tonight!</p>
<p>Today, my best friend Janet called me and I met her at my home group.  I biked there, coz my car is noisier than an WWII bomber, and I don't need yappy neighbors.  Janet took me back downtown in her van.  We also 5 hours later had pizza together: her treat.  She told me that there's something in the air these days; all the negative news in the papers and on the radio. </p>
<p>I'm feeling a little down.  Maybe it's the ice cream from last night.  As I think about how it's affected my mood, even now I'm still thinking of eating more.  I also wanna go home and fool with my computer; I want to go buy a charger for my phone, and I'm tired.</p>
<p>I don't wanna go see my sponsor tomorrow.  Bleh.  I wish my car wasn't so dang noisy.  Part of me would like to fix it; that should be fun.</p>
<p>I also need to make some prices so I can get some moving money. </p>
<p>Oh yes, I won a Lottario ticket worth $2.00 at the dance on Saturday night.  I'm gonna check my numbers online.  I know nothing about these lottery tickets.  If I'm a zillionaire, I'll probably come back here and edit the message, so you can assume I didn't win!</p>
