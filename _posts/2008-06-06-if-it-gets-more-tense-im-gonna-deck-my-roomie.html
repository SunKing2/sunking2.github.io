<p>Ok, so I slept in the tent last night, on Ellen's deck.  Now I know where the expression "happy camper" exists.  I'm not one.  I'm damp.  I feel icky.  I need  a shower.  I need a freakin' bed!</p>
<p>Ok, so I'm telling Ellen that if I'm not emptying my car into my new room today by 3pm, I'm freakin outa here.  Last night, while unable to sleep, I went and bought a mondo bag of chips; ate half.  It was thirty minutes after midnight.  It's not the best sleeping agent, but I guess my sleeping quarters are not currently attracting cuter ones.</p>
<p>I can't tent no more.  It was raining like heck.  Ick.</p>
<p>I went to the breakfast meeting this morning after about five days haiatus from lack of support.  It was ok.  One older member heard my dissatisfaction with my tent situation.  I shared "I didn't drink last night, I didn't drink today".  That was pretty much it... I didn't even say why.</p>
<p>I'm heading to the lunch meeting downtown.  Maybe I'll see Ellen there.  I'm not holding my breath.  On the way I'll have chips for brekkie.  :)</p>
