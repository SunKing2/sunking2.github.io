<p>My day is filled with activities that I don't like.  What strange behavior, I'm coming to see.  Right off the bat, I meditate for exactly 36 minutes.  No more, no less.  And I dislike just about all of it, I think.  And my meditation is broken down into several meditation segments where I do a meditation activity, and this almost never changes, because I've found a way to fill up the boring 36 minutes.  Is this benefitting me?  I wonder.</p>
<p>I'm going to write daily, and I challenge my reader(s) to do the same.</p>
