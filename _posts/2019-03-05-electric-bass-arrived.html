<p>I'm taking electric bass lessons from the Fender website.  It looks like I can work with their videos, so I subscribed for a year ($122 CDN).</p>
<p>I bought this electric bass</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Yamaha-TRBX174-OVS-4-String-Electric/dp/B00GOE7XHE">Yamaha Electric Bass (Amazon.ca, $250)<img class=" alignright" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/71f6myiGwyL._SY879_.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I started a 14-day free trial for lessons at the Fender Play website: <a href="https://www.fender.com/play/pages/bass-lessons?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIv4-btIbs4AIVk4qzCh32Gwg0EAAYASAAEgJ3EvD_BwE">Fender Play Bass Lessons</a>. I also agreed to a year subscription</p>
<p>Then I said, hey I need a bass, so I bought one on Amazon.ca.  The price was $250CDN plus tax.  I ordered on  a Friday, it came to my door on Monday (yesterday).</p>
<p>I practiced for about 20-40 minutes yesterday with the online videos.</p>
<p>It's the #3 top seller in bass guitars on that site, and the first one with a decent brand name.</p>
<p>It's a fine bass.  I likes it, and am glad I bought it.  Yesterday, I did the first 3 lessons in the Fender series.</p>
<p>It surprised me I have to cut my right hand nails for it; something I reluctantly did, coz I need them for classical guitar.</p>
<p>I guess I'll have to concentrate on bass, violin and piano for awhile with these short nails.</p>
