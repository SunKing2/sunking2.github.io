<p>Demolition experts debunk the Twin Towers 911 World Trade Center and how is it that a a modern day 110 storey building can crumble  when the buildings were designed to withstand the impact of a Boeing 707 on any part of the building.</p>
<p>See this video on YouTube at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMWn-bQYfSc">911 Mysteries.  Part 1 Demolitions: The Myth</a></p>

<p>The power of the Executive to cast a man into prison without<br />formulating any charge known to the law, and particularly to deny him<br />the judgement of his peers, is in the highest degree odious and is the<br />foundation of all totalitarian government whether Nazi or Communist," -<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Winston Churchill</span>, November 21, 1943</p>
