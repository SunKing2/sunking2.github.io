<p>I got up extra early, and did some practice, then instead of meditation, I went to a meeting.  However this morning's practice, was, um, seemingly unproductive.  I concentrated obsessively on two bars.  And I did this on multiple pieces.  So I would say, very little of this will contribute to my being able to play the piece in 6 days.</p>
<p>When I returned, I did some older pieces, and began to realize how many old pieces I have on the go.  I might want to think that over.</p>
