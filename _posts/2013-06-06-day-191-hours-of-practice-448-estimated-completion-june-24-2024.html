<p>I've been keeping piano playing stats since November 28, 2012.  I write down how many minutes I play each piece.  One page per day.  Then on occasion, I enter them into the computer, which gives me stats.  So I'll have my 10,000 hours in 2024.  I have a little more than 11 years left.</p>
<p>Today was an unusually productive day with 202 minutes.  I'm working on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Satin Doll (Duke Ellington), started Apr 17</li>
<li>Sonatine in C Major - Part I (Repertoire book 3, p 16), started Apr 24</li>
<li>Solitude (Duke Ellington et. al), started May 11</li>
</ul>
<p>So today, along with my usual scales, blues chords, and sight-reading exercises that I almost always do, I was able to do the above three pieces in two separate sessions, and I worked extra long on them in the second session. </p>
<p>I was reading a bit about <a title="The Talent Code (Amazon.com)" href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Talent-Code-Greatness-Grown/dp/055380684X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370558335&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=talent+code">"The Talent Code"</a> which stresses Deep Practice, and I've been working on that today.  Instead of just going through difficult parts of the song, I'd play until I made a mistake, then replay just before the mistake, and redo it multiple times until I could play it mistake-free.  I think that up to this time, I would make the difficult measures a drill exercise: play them over and over.  But the difference here is to play until a mistake, and THEN redo.  Now a redo is only necessary if I make a mistake.  It might work.</p>
<p>I first heard about the 10,000 hours by reading <a title="Outliers (Amazon.com)" href="http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370558256&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=10%2C000+gladwell">Outliers</a>, but my landlord told me about "The Talent Code" just this week.  I think <a title="Outliers (Amazon.com)" href="http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370558256&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=10%2C000+gladwell">Outliers</a> is a great book, and it should be read if you haven't already.   Some of it seems useful.</p>
