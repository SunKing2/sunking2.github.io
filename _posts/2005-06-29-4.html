<p>I should know those four and five letter vowel dumps, but I'm down to only</p>
<p>AACEI AECIA<br />AIILO AIOLI<br />ADIIO OIDIA<br />ALUU LUAU</p>
<p>I sorted the fours by reverse points in Lexpert, and went through the alphagrams until I had about 60 that I didn't know. So today I studied all the 12+ point fours (50 that I didn't know). At least now I'll know what I've studied and what I have not.</p>
<p>Playing a game today with "fard" showing up leads me to think it's useful to look at the biggies first.</p>
<p>In ISC I went from 860 to 937 in the last 10 games. I lost 2. The first one I had beautiful letters but I played a series of 10 point plays. The other loss was against a lower rated player, but it was a 10 minute game; I always play 25 minute games.</p>
