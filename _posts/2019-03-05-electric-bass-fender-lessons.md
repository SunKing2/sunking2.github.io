<p>Iâ€™m taking electric bass lessons from the Fender website. 
I started a 14-day free trial for lessons at the Fender Play website: <a href="https://www.fender.com/play/pages/bass-lessons">Fender Play Bass Lessons</a>. </p>
<p>
I practiced for about 20-40 minutes yesterday with their online videos.</p>
<p>It looks like I can work with their videos, so I subscribed for a year ($122 CDN).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Yamaha-TRBX174-OVS-4-String-Electric/dp/B00GOE7XHE">Yamaha Electric Bass (Amazon.ca, $250, 2 business day delivery)<img class=" alignright" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/71f6myiGwyL._SY879_.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Yesterday, I did the first 3 lessons in the Fender series.</p>
<p>It surprised me I have to cut my right hand nails for it; something I reluctantly did, coz I need them for classical guitar.</p>
<p>I guess I'll have to concentrate on bass, violin and piano for awhile with these short nails.</p>
