<p>I heard on the radio "Make a New Year's resolution to listen to more great Canadian music". Does she really believe anyone is going to do this? It's just filler like almost all radio chatter.  We don't need to constantly hear someone chatter just to fill in space.  <a href="http://plinkplinktwang.com/?q=content/way-people-talk-formal-work-and-filler">More</a></p>
