<p>I've been counting.  And I track my hours every day.  On average, I have practice 160 minutes per day since I started. </p>
<p>Today I exceeded 1400 hours, which is 1/7th the way to 10,000.</p>
<p>The computer forecasted that I will finish on January 1st, 2023.  (Yes that actual date, just by coincidence).</p>
<p>If that's true, I will not even be 60 yet, far from it!  I may still have brain cells left.  ( I will be be just over 58)</p>
