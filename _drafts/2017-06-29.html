<p>I don't know what to write so I'll just write for twenty minutes and hope something comes up.</p>
<p>I found a peace yesterday when doing my Haskell readings, documenting what I'd read and doing some programming to reinforce my learning.  I added a reference to the source book in some of the notes, and then I took the chance and renumbered haskell, and haskell1 to haskell9 to haskell01 to haskell09.txt.</p>
<p>This is not very good writing.</p>
<p>I am thinking lately about my need to be alone is similar to a wounded animal in the woods; I have to just be quiet, lay there, and let nature heal me.  The injured deer does not go out and socialize and play and do the daily deer things, but just takes the time needed instead.</p>
<p>Zen Guitar: p 162</p>
<blockquote><p>Enter by form, exit from form."  We diligently learn all the rules of music - theory, scales, harmony, technique.  We "exit from form" when having internalized the rules, we throw them all out and just play.</p>
<p>Onstage we exit from form when we improvise out of what's written and go to uncharted territory... we transcend [form]</p></blockquote>
<p>Codependent No More, p65:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a large chorus ... if the guy next to us gets off key, must we?  Wouldn't it help him, and us, more to strive to stay on key?  We can learn to hold our part.</p>
<p>Reacting: Rarely can we do our best at anything in this state of mind.  There is little in our lives that we cannot do better if we are peaceful.</p>
<p>We don't have to forfeit our peace.  We don't have to forfeit our power to think and feel for anyone or anything.</p>
<p>If someone rejects you or your choices, you are still real, and you are still worth every bit as much as you would be if you had not been rejected.</p>
<p>Feel any feelings that go with rejection, talk about your thoughts, but don't forfeit your self-esteem to another's disapproval or rejection of who you are or what you have done.</p>
<p>...But don't reject yourself, and don't give so much power to other people's rejection of you.</p>
<p>Practice detachment.  Separate yourself from this.  Leave things alone, let people be who they are.</p>
<p>We don't have to react.  We can exercise our right to choose how we want to act, think, feel and behave.  We feel better and stronger.</p>
<p>Do they deserve the brunt of my turmoil?  Maybe but</p>
<ul>
<li>your lack of peace</li>
<li>your lack of serenity</li>
<li>wasted moments</li>
</ul>
<p>Ralph Edwards: "This is your life".  How do you want to spend it?</p>
<p>You are detaching for you, not for him/her.</p></blockquote>
