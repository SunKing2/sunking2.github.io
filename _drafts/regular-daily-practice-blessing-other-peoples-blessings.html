<p>Here's a video, which was posted on Heather MacDonald's Facebook page, I saw today on our ability to receive, welcoming abundance, there's no separation between us and them, especially between the giver and receiver, and how blessing what other people have may lead to abundance for ourselves in similar ways.  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/katerina.satori/videos/10154683681583543/?pnref=story">Katerina Satoria: Are You Having Trouble With Receiving- June 6, 2017, FB</a>.  She says this will help your ability to receive:</p>
<blockquote><p>You see somebody experiencing what you desire to have.  Maybe you see a couple... and instead of that experience triggering you because you don't have it in the moment, you send them a blessing.  You say "I bless your love".  You see somebody driving in a car you love; "Wow, I love this; I bless this for you".</p>
<p>So whatever you see; desire to have, whatever you want, send a mental blessing.  And experiment with this because your subconscious mind hears it as <em>you welcoming that experience into your life</em>.</p>
<p>Because you don't see any separation.  Every time you curse somebody, spell a judgement on somebody.  You see somebody [physical description omitted], and instant judgement goes in.  Catch yourself, (don't crucify your self for it), but forgive yourself, and say "How can I find compassion?".   How can I send love and blessing to this person who is obviously struggling with the body?</p>
<p>Watch your mind going instantly into judgement.  Can you redirect the judgement and turn it into a gift?</p>
<p>You begin to consciously notice that there's no separation between you and another.  Your ability to receive will naturally expand.  You'll lose the illusion that when you receive, somebody else loses.</p></blockquote>
<p>So I just sent a private message to Katerina.  I don't usually do those things, but it's because of something I heard or saw yesterday about claiming my own space in the universe, and it's OK to do so.  Maybe that was in either her video or Heather's page.  I also texted Heather yesterday, and she accepted me as a FB friend.  I'm not going to follow up with her, but I find Heather's FB page so inspiring.</p>
