<p>Once I read that when doing meditation, it's helpful to keep a straight back.  We are majestic humans and in the presence of our higher power, we should adopt a pose reflecting this majesty, regardless of how we feel.  I think about my meditation time as a time that I spend with my higher power.  If I were on a spiritual plane, I'd make sure that I wouldn't be presenting myself in a negative way to my higher power.  The "majestic" idea is also one that reminds me that I'm a spiritual being and at least for those moments, choose to remember that and take up a pose reflective of this spiritual nature.</p>

<p>A friend talked to me last week about doing meditation in a way that I didn't think I'd be willing to try.  But I figured it was presented to me, so it is possible that this may be what I'm supposed to do.</p>
<p>The suggestion was to hold a thumb and a finger together during meditation, and later on in the day, when you need to get back to that "happy place", you can just do that little finger action to bring yourself back to a place of more serenity.   I've been doing this meditation technique for over a week, but I didn't ever try the second part - which is to use it later in the day to bring myself back to that tranquil place.</p>

<p>Yesterday night I was fairly distressed and I did it.  The first thing I noticed was that I realized almost instantly that what was causing me so much stress and pain were just things in my mind, they were not real, and they were not permanent.  So in a way, it served as a kind of "grounding"; a term that I only really heard about this year.  I asked somebody about it, and I think I was hearing that it takes you out of your mind, making you aware of your present surroundings and the "now", and trying to see the present reality, rather than living in the mind-created scenario, which was the cause of the distress in the first place.</p>
<p>The other technique I was shown was one requiring me to look at a spot on the wall.  To the left of that spot is my current flawed self.  To the right of that spot is the self that I want to be, without the current character defect that I've been thinking about.  Or perhaps the right side is a more loving, giving caring person.  Whatever we would aspire to be.</p>

<p>So we concentrate on the right-hand side of this spot.  This has the effect that subconsciously during the day, our actions will begin to reflect this desire to be the better person.</p>
<p>When I heard of these techniques, I thought that I'm comfortable doing what I do during meditation, and I'm not really open to changing it.  I especially thought that I can't do meditation with open eyes.  I did them anyway.  But with regard to the open-eyes thing, I decided to do part of my meditation time with closed eyes and "pinched fingers" and the other half with open eyes and pinched fingers.  It seems to be working.</p>
