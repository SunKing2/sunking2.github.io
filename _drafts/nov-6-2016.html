<blockquote>  nonsense of political correctness and social consensus which is almost always based on the loudest mouth, not the biggest brain. - Dr. Michael Persinger</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>What does it take to come to the place where we can exchange pride for humility? First we must stop the blasphemous charade of pretending that we are no good. "I'm worthless" has often been spoken in the name of humility. But these words, or any other words that express the same sentiment, are a self-indulgence and a cop-out.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>You were deeply connected to a beloved person, but they never appreciated the person you really are.  Your best was never good enough.  This hurt you deeply but you are stronger today than you've ever been.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Thought for the week: Learn a new skill</p>
<p>It's an esteemable act to have the courage to learn something new.</p>
<p>Affirmations for the week:</p>
<p>I am willing to learn a new skill. This week, I will do something I'm not yet good at.</p>
<p>Esteemable actions for the week</p>
<p>Have you ever avoided doing something because it was too hard or too scary? Have you ever not learned a new skill because you were afraid you'd make a mistake or just look silly? If you're like most of us, you've been there - done that. And like many people, you've missed out on a great deal of fun and opportunity because you were afraid to learn something new.</p>
<p>Think of things you're good at. Now remember the first time you did that activity. I bet you weren't very good. Actually, if you're like me, you had to try, try, and try again before you got into the swing of things. Am I right? Yet it was the conscious, consistent practice of that new skill that ultimately made you proficient and confident that you could do it. Think about how good you felt when you finally got it right.</p>
<p>No question about it, learning a new skill is hard, it's scary, and at times it's embarrassing. In the past, each time I tried something new and didn't get it the first time, I wanted to give up. It felt like the end of my world. But I didn't give up. There are even days when I know what I'm doing and still feel like I'm off the beam. And on those days, I just don't give up.</p>
<p>Today I know whatever I'm experiencing is part of my learning process, whether it's using my computer or speaking in front of an audience. My job is to remain teachable.</p></blockquote>

<p>http://thoughtcatalog.com/jamie-varon/2014/05/10-unconventional-ways-to-make-yourself-more-attractive/  Understand what it is about you that makes you extraordinary. Let your humor and your intelligence and your particular brand of uniqueness shine through without provocation or hesitance. A person who knows who they are and what they have to offer is an attractive one. ...you will be treated in the same way that you treat yourself. If you are kind and gentle to yourself, you will be treated in the same way. (You may be shaking your head furiously at me right now insistent that this is not true, but it is! Most of us just have never experienced how the world treats us when we are kind and gentle to ourselves, because it’s very, very, very difficult to be truly kind and gentle to ourselves.)  When you treat yourself kindly and have compassion for yourself, another person’s rudeness will not bother you and, in fact, you’ll show them even more compassion. Learning to not take things personally is a universally attractive trait, as people are more likely to be drawn to you if they feel that you will treat them with kindness and understanding.  Fixate on the kindness you receive and watch it multiply. If, after a day of work, you could spend more of your brainpower or more of your happy hour discussing the love you received, versus the love that was withheld from you.  If someone is bothering or annoying you, take a step back and send them love and light. Not only will you instantly feel better about them, but they will probably end up being more bearable to you. Send love and light often and without prejudice.</p>
<h3>Smile and make eye contact with people</h3>
<p>This is probably the simplest and easiest one to add into your life right now. There is absolutely nothing that can replace the magnitude of a genuine smile and eye contact. Practice doing this with baristas or checkout clerks and see how surprised they are when you look at them and ask how they are with interest and intent.</p>
