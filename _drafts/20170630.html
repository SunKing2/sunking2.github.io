<p>Practicing leads to a certain discipline whose effect spills over into my study of Haskell.    I don't want to do the F minor scale, but I do it, and then do it some more until I can do it without thinking about how much I don't want to do it.  The same for studying Haskell.  There are sections of the books that just seem impenetrable and I'd prefer to avoid them.  The explanations given with these sections are insufficient to aid my understanding, and so I would rather avoid them, or at best, plow through them, taking notes, but not knowing what I'm reading.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was taking notes on conditionals, and the material mentioned the if, case, and some | syntax, with examples.  But I've not seen any of these used before, so I had no idea really what I was reading.</p>
<p>I'm hoping that just going through the motions and maybe future repeated practice will lead me to learn them; even though I'm not understanding them.</p>
<p>I'd just done what I thought was 15 minutes of writing, but I was interrupted by tea and bathroom, and so I got lost.  I reset the timer to 20 minutes at the beginning of this paragraph; hopefully, I can have an uninterrupted 20 minutes.</p>
<p>I don't know why this Wordpress editor scrolls below the screen; I then have to move my mouse to find my way again.  Very annoying.  I'd like to do all my writing on my computer, and back it up with Github; but that's public, and I don't want my drafts to be public, especially not my daily 20-minute writing.</p>
<p>there, it's scrolled off the screen again, and I can't see what I'm writing.  Very sucky.  Why does it do this?</p>
<p>I think I read last night, ya I did.  "Miracles Happen", "Codependent No More", and my book of the day was "First Learn to Practice".  I read the first two every time, and my "book of the day" is a different inspirational/spiritual book daily.</p>
<p>I did a search of "writer's tools" or something like that, and the first thing I found was a "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/8883701127/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=8883701127&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thewripra-20&amp;linkId=FTIOTI55JK2NVHZY">Moleskine Classic</a>".  This came from the article "<a href="http://thewritepractice.com/creative-writing-tools/">The Creative Writer’s Toolkit: 6 Tools You Can’t Write Without</a>".  Ok, I just spent 5 minutes making links work.  I wonder if that's a good use of time?  Well, I need to learn how to use these tools.</p>
<p>I'd like, also, to insert graphics in my daily writing.  For me, I'm much more pleased with my articles if I have some carefully spaced graphics in them.</p>
<p>I notice that I started my writing today by trying to sound like a writer.  That may be a little forced -- unnatural, and artificial sounding.  Not being me.  I think I'd probably like my own plain writing better than anything fancy-looking that seems artificial.</p>
<p>Oh, with regard to the Moleskine Classic: I thought immediately I should give this as a gift to an aspiring writer; then I thought Shanna might be a good candidate.  But I decided to stop looking, thought it might be the caffeine speaking, and now I think that it was just a diversion that I let myself get into while I was supposed to be writing.  The Internet is bad that way; it makes you forget your purpose.</p>
<p>I get diverted quite frequently when studying Haskell.  I started with the book "Learn You a Haskell", then I switched almost completely to "Programming in Haskell" after realizing the first book was too wordy, and impractical, concentrating only on toy samples of code, and not programs.</p>
<p>Then I looked at some web sites, and followed various tutorials, then I discovered that the book "<a href="http://haskellbook.com/">Haskell Programming from First Principles</a>" and later a tutorial <a href="https://functional-programming.it.jyu.fi/master/pages/Tasks.md">TIEA341 functional-programming</a></p>
