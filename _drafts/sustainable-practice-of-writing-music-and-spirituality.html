<p>I practiced the piano for four years, and I meditate daily.   It takes a huge investment in time to become even moderately good in some things.</p>
<p>Like piano practice, or reading a new book, we may approach it with enthusiasm, commit ourselves to spending 3 hours a day with it, but what happens?  We fizzle out.</p>
<p>I read a posting on this.  It was saying we should do something sustainable, like 10 or 15 minutes a day.  That way, on tough days we are looking only at "I have to do this for 10 minutes, and so it'll be over with quickly".  Rather than, what we usually do, which is: "Hmm I have been doing 3 hours a day, and I don't feel well today, so 3 hours seems like a lot, so I'll just surf the Internet for a while, and ...."  Of course, we quit.</p>
<p>The point is, we'll gain a lot by 10 minutes a day.  We may think it is useless.  But it is sustainable, and the accretion of time over the long run by daily practice is far better than "spurts" approach.</p>
<p>I'm trying to learn Haskell, a fairly intellectual computer language, and it's completely different from everything I've known.  I'm seeing that in order to learn it, I'll have to invest a lot of time in it.</p>
<p>Here is the article info:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="blog">“binge” writers  write between 2 and 12 hours in one day, but then do not return to writing for a week or more verses more regular writers who write for short periods but write every day) [...] One assumption is that writers are most productive if they write when the mood hits ... they can spend hours of uninterrupted time at the task, i.e. “binge writing.”.  Conclusion: Daily writers are more productive than binge writers and generated more creative ideas for writing than did subjects who wrote spontaneously”  <a href="https://www.academiccoachingandwriting.org/academic-writing/academic-writing-blog/ii-challenge-common-assumptions-against-daily-writing">Challenge Common Assumptions Against Daily Writing (2012) Dr. Sally</a><br />

<p>I've religiously been doing morning meditation, and for years I'd insist on a minimum of x many minutes otherwise there's no point.  But over the last 3 months, I've done the following.</p>
<p>After my readings, and my morning 5 written gratitudes and 3 written likes about myself [thanks, Shanna], I've meditated 8 to 10 minutes.  And what really works is that most days I don't want to do it.  I mean many days I really, really don't want to.   But I'm able to do it daily (missing maybe 5 days in the last 3 months) because it is such a small investment.  And, if I believe that the value is in the daily practice (regardless of how small this practice is), this will bring the benefits.</p>
<p>The first two hours of the day are the most productive.  Don't waste them.</p>
<p>My twenty minutes started at the beginning of this sentence.  I figure 20 minutes of writing a day might make me produce more useful stuff (almost like a million monkeys typing enough keystrokes may be able to create the text of Romeo and Juliet, lol).</p>
<p>I stopped daily piano practice on December 6, 2016, and since then have had a few stretches where I'd practice daily for weeks, and then stop for weeks.  Today I practiced 15 minutes, the first time really since May 31st.  But I can do 15 minutes a day.  I'll make it a job.  It doesn't matter if I like it; I know that I'll like some of it.  But I'm supposed to be doing it, and as I've said yesterday, it's the small daily practices that work, not the binge practice.</p>
<p>Same with writing.  So I'll write for 20 minutes a day. So my 20 minutes is up about 8 minutes ago, but, hey, it's a start.  Bless you.  :)</p>
