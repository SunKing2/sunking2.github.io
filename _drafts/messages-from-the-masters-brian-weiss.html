<p><i><span style="color:#800080;"><span style="font-size:large;"><span style="font-family:Georgia;">We are born with a considerable memory of our true home, the other side, that beautiful dimension that we have just left in order to enter our physical body  once again. We are born with a huge capacity to receive  and to give love, to experience  pure joy and to experience the present moment fully. As babies we do not worry about the past or the future. We feel and live spontaneously and completely in the moment as we were meant to experience this physical dimension.<br />
The assault on our minds begins when we are very young  children. We are indoctrinated by parents, society, religious values and opinions that suppress our inborn knowledge. Should we resist this , we are then threatened  with fear, guilt, humiliation..A withdrawal of love, or physical and emotional abuse may also loom.<br />
Our parents , teachers, society or culture can and often do teach us dangerous falsehoods. our world is evidence of this, as it staggers  toward irreversible destruction.<br />
If we allow them children can show us the way out.</span></span></span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[...] You can, however, retrieve this knowledge from your past-life memory banks.  Children are especially adept at this.</p>
<p>For example, you can ask your young child if he or she remembers when they were "big" before.  Liston to the answers because it may be more than the product of an active imagination.  Your child may actually provide details of a past life.</p>
<p>Observing the joy and spontaneity of children at play is always rewarding.  Many of us have forgotten how to have fun and enjoy the simple pleasures of life.  We worry too much about concepts such as success and failure, what kind of impression we are making on others, and about the future.  We have forgotten how to play and have fun, and our children remind us.</p>
<p>They remind us of our earliest values, of those things that are also really important in life: joy, fun, mindfulness of the present moment, trust, and the value of good relationships.</p>
<p>Our children have so much to teach us.</p>
<hr />
<p>After our birth in the physical state, our main source of learning is through relationships. Through the joy and pain of interaction with other people, we progress on our spiritual paths in order to learn from all sides. Relationships are a living laboratory, a field test to determine how we are doing, whether our lessons have been learned, to discover how close we are to our pre-determined life plan. In relationships our emotions are evoked and we react. Do we reach out to others with understanding,love, and compassion,or do we react with fear,selfishness or rejection?  Without relationships we would not know; we could never test our progress. They are wonderful but difficult opportunities to learn.<br />
More learning can occur when there are many obstacles than when there are few or none. A life with difficult relationships,filled with obstacles and losses,presents the most amazing opportunity for learning and souls' growth. Harder the relationship, faster is the souls' progress. Destiny may need a little more time to weave its tapestry. In addition to pain and hardship, there is also love and joy and ecstasy in the world. Love isn't an intellectual process but rather a dynamic energy flowing into and through us at all times,whether we are aware of it or not.</p>
<p>There are various ways to mentor and cater the fragility of relationships. Lets take a look at the most important ones.</p>
<p>1: <span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span">Increasing Self-Awareness and Others'.</span></span><br />
Consider yourself as whole and place yourself on the highest priority. Understand the nature of thy-self, the Real Self, which is immortal. This understanding will help you keep things in proper perspective. Know thy self clearly to see without the distortions of the conscious mind or the sub conscious . Practice detached observations, peaceful perception, feeling a sense of detached loving-kindness or loving detachment. Cultivate this state.<br />
Know your thoughts and assumptions, and realize that you may have swallowed them whole. When you generalize into groups or stereo types, you stop seeing the unique individual. Erroneous assumptions from the past lead to distorted reality. Experience is much stronger than belief. Learn from thy experience. What helps without harming is valuable.Discard outdated beliefs and thoughts.Happiness comes from within. It is not dependent on external things or on other people.You become vulnerable and can be easily hurt when your feelings of security and happiness depend on the behavior and actions of the other.Never give your power to anyone.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span">"I was always less than perfect, but self awareness is a wonderful thing."</span></span></span></p>
<p>2: <span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span">Love Yourself.</span></span><br />
Don't worry about the opinions of others. If you really need to and want to decline some offer or obligation,say so. If you fail to do so, anger will creep in. You will resent the commitment, and you would resent the person who obligated you. It is better to say no when you need to and to say yes when you want to. Physical illness often follows when one is not able to decline unwanted commitments, because this is a more "acceptable" way of saying no. Then you have no choice but to decline because your body says no for you. It is much healthier to assert yourself. Stress is when your mind says no, but your mouth opens up and says yes.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span">"The way you treat yourself sets the standard for others."</span></span></span></p>
<p>3: <span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span">Understand Freedom.</span></span><br />
One of the most important of life's lessons is to learn independence, to understand freedom.This means independence from attachments, from results, from opinions, and from expectations. Breaking attachments leads to freedom, but breaking relationships doesn't mean abandoning loved ones or loving and meaningful relationship, a relationship that nourishes your soul. It means ending dependency on any person or thing. Love is never dependency. Love is an absolute,unconditional,and timeless state that asks for nothing in return. Never obey a destructive relationship which lacks understanding and freedom to exercise free-will. It is important to remember love is timeless and one would have many chances to set it right.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span">"There are two freedoms - the false, where a man is free to do what he likes; the true, where he is free to do what he ought"</span></span></span></p>
<p>4: <span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span">Consider Guides but decide Guidance.</span></span><br />
See the other person clearly and don't put that person on a pedestal. Parents,teachers, authorities are just people like you. They have their own fears, doubts, anxieties, and imperfections. They also have their own agendas, and sometimes you are pawn in their games. Their judgements carry no extra weight. Consider their opinions. They may be wise.They may be right. But they may also be wrong. Learn to see with your heart and not just eyes.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span">"Don't let people drive you crazy when you know it's in walking distance."</span></span></span></p>
<p>5: <span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span">See RelationShip as Lease.</span></span><br />
Relationships need nurturing and attention.Detach from your fears and negative emotions. When you need to talk or communicate, reset your priorities.Devote time and energy to the other person.Bring full attention and awareness to the relationships and its problems. Do not take anything for granted.Do not stay in your rut.Renew the relationship through loving actions. The relationship is living,alive in the present.Its not a thing of the past. Its is a thing of future. Coming day is the day which requires more love than today. Tomorrow is more deserving. Always nurture your love. It grows !</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span">"We've got this gift of love, but love is like a precious plant. You can't just accept it and leave it in the cupboard or just think it's going to get on by itself. You've got to keep watering it. You've got to really look after it and nurture it."</span></span></span></p>
<p>6: <span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span">Love Completely.</span></span><br />
It is save to love completely, without holding back. You can never be truly rejected. It is only when ego is involved that we feel bruised and vulnerable. Love itself is all absolute and all encompassing. The concept of loving completely and without any reservation may seem risky or even dangerous to many. I am not, however talking about self-abrogation in a relationship,not enduring a relationship that is abusive or damaging. Doing so is not loving yourself or to the other. Staying in a destructive relationship is not an example of loving without reservation-instead it may be more a manifestation of low self-esteem and lack of self-love than anything else. People can be dangerous , but love is not.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span">"Love means to commit oneself without guarantee, to give oneself completely in the hope that our love will produce love in the loved person. Love is an act of faith, and whoever is of little faith is also of little love."</span></span></span></p>
<p>7: <span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span">Clean Yourself.</span></span><br />
We are all created in the image of almighty GOD, and GOD is within all of us. Our basic underlying nature is loving, peaceful, balanced, and harmonious. We are innately compassionate, caring, and kind. We are souls. Over the course of our lifetimes, an overlay of fear, anger, envy, sadness, insecurity, and many other negative thoughts and emotions accrues and covers our beautiful inner nature. This outer covering is intensified and reinforced by our childhood training and experiences in the current life. We appear to be what we are not-angry and fearful people, filled with insecurity, guilt, and self-doubts. We have forgotten who we really are. We do not need to learn about love and balance, about peace and compassion, about forgiveness and faith. We have always known these things. Instead, our task is to unlearn those negative and harmful emotions and attitudes that plague our lives and cause us, our communities, and our world such misery. As we let go of these negative traits, lo and behold, we rediscover our true nature, our positive and loving self. It has been there all the time, covered over, obscured, and forgotten.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span">"Reach high, for stars lie hidden in your soul. Dream deep, for every dream precedes the goal."</span></span></span></p>
<p>8: <span class="Apple-style-span">Let go off Anger.</span><br />
Anger is a defense of the ego, defense against fear. Fear of being humiliated or embarrassed, fear of being minimized, of being mocked, fear of loss and of losing face, indeed fear of losing. Fear is not getting your way. We think anger "protects" us against the others, who would do these things to us, who likewise are angry with us. Anger is a pernicious and useless emotion. It is dissolved by understanding and by love. When a negative emotion is understood, when its roots are illuminated, the energy behind the emotion diminishes and even disappears. When you feel angry, the healthy response is to learn what caused the anger, to rectify the situation if that is possible, and then to let go of the anger. We are all connected, we are all the same, we are all rowing in the same boat.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span">"Anger ventilated often hurries toward forgiveness; and concealed often hardens into revenge."</span></span></span></p>
<p>9: <span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span">Let go off Fear.</span></span><br />
The walls that we put around ourselves whenever we feel emotionally threatened are walls of fear. We fear being hurt, rejected,ostracized. We are threaten by our own vulnerability, and we wall ourselves off so that we do not feel. Our emotions are suppressed. Sometime we even reject the person or people who threaten us before they can reject us. We beat them to the punch. This form of self-protection is known as counter-phobic defense. Unfortunately, our walls hurt us more than any other person could. Our walls block us off, close our hearts, worsen our conditions. When we are walled off, when we are separated from our emotions and feelings, we can never reach the source of our suffering, the underlying fears and vulnerabilities. We cannot understand the real roots of our problems. We cannot heal, we cannot be whole.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span">"Ultimately we know deeply that the other side of every fear is a freedom."</span></span></span></p>
<p>10: <span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span">Let go off Insecurity.</span></span><br />
One of our greatest faults is our overwhelming concern about outcomes. We are preoccupied with results, and this preoccupation creates unnecessary anxiety, fear, and unhappiness. The anxiety is about our performance. what if our performance doesn't measure up.? What if we fail? What would others think.? How harshly we will we judge ourselves.? The fear relates to the loss of the desired goal or object. If we fail, we are convinced we will not get what we want. We will be failures, losers. We will be rejected.We will hate ourselves. Instead of worrying about specific outcomes and results, just do the right thing. Reach out unselfishly.Hope for the best. Hope if fine. Expectation is not, because when expectation is present, disappointment is always lurking nearby. Love only deals in love. Love trades love.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span">"Insecurity exists in the absence of knowledge."</span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span">All is love .... All is love. With Love comes understanding. With understanding comes patience.And then time stops. And everything is now.</span></span></span></p>
